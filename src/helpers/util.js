The diagnosis confirmed the severity of his malnutrition, and treatment began without delay. He was placed on a structured feeding plan to restore his nutritional balance and provided with the medical care necessary for recovery.",

      "Sa’adatu’s journey began in Gwoza, Borno State, where her family lived before insurgency forced them to flee their hometown over a decade ago. Seeking refuge in Adamawa State, the family faced continued instability and was eventually displaced again. Sa’adatu, along with her husband and daughter, eventually found herself in an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in Abuja.",
      "When we met Sa’adatu last August, she welcomed us into her modest living space at the IDP camp. Her reality was a stark reminder of the hardships faced by displaced persons. Rain had soaked their mattress, their cooking items were scattered outside, and the makeshift kitchen was barely functional. The shared toilet facilities were in deplorable condition. Yet, despite these challenges, Sa’adatu remained gracious and willing to share her story.",
      "At the time, Sa’adatu was pregnant but battling a series of untreated infections. Tragically, she lost her pregnancy due to a lack of access to adequate healthcare.",
